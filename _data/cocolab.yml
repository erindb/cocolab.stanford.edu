          I'm interested in how visual perception, action, and social inference are coordinated to support learning and communication.
          To get at this, I derive inspiration from how people draw.

          I received my PhD in cognitive psychology from Princeton in 2016, and my AB in neurobiology
          from Harvard in 2010.

          There are these things called ideas and some seem clear. And yet
          communication with natural language &mdash; our primary mode of
          conveying these ideas &mdash; is anything but!
        - >
          I'm interested in this interplay between natural and formal language,
          between the fuzzy and the sharp. I use computational models and
          behavioral experiments to explore how logic and language interact.

          I'm interested in the cognitive mechanisms that allow people to
          flexibly coordinate with one another. In particular, I study the
          formation of conventions and norms using multi-player experiments and
          computational models of communication and social reasoning.

          I'm interested in problems at the intersection of language and
          vision. I develop probabilistic and neural network models with the
          joint objective of explaining human behavioral data and building AI
          with more human-like representations and capacities.
