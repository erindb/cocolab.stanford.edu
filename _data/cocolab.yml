          A remarkable feature of human language is that listeners typically
          have little difficulty inferring what a speaker intends to convey
          even though much of the relevant information is not encoded
          explicitly in the utterance. I use behavioral and computational
          methods to study how listeners settle on an interpretation, given
          an underspecified utterance. I'm particularly interested in how the
          more fixed, semantic aspects of utterances interact with contextual
          information and principles of cooperative communication.

          I am interested in automated science and developing closed-loop
          methods to automatically discover the underlying structure in complex
          phenomena which remain elusive to current approaches. I use
          computational models to study how mechanistic models can be
          automatically uncovered and how experiments can be optimally
          designed to elicit behaviors that disambiguate competing models.
          I've worked previously on inferring structure in dynamical systems
          and I am currently pursuing projects for automated psychology
          experiment design.

          Central to theories of natural language are speakers' mental
          representations of the words they use, together with the ways these
          representations are employed in computing the meaning of the sentences
          that contain them. Identifying the mental representations of our
          speech and the computational system that manipulates them informs
          not just the cognitive underpinnings of language, but also how the
          mind works more generally. My work investigates these representations
          as a means to further our understanding of language and the
          psychological systems that shape it. Recent projects have focused
          on linguistic phenomena that appeal to or facilitate measurement,
          targeting representations of plurality, degree, and number.

          I want to understand how to represent, learn, and reason with
          structured knowledge. I work on probabilistic programming as a means
          of knowledge representation, and probabilistic inference as a method
          of machine learning and reasoning. I am broadly interested in topics
          in cognitive science and artificial intelligence that contribute to
          this project, including concept learning, theory of mind, game
          theory, and decision theory.

          I've been looking at how past actions are used to infer and inform
          beliefs and preferences. To explore this question, I've drawn upon
          social and cognitive psychology, decision making, and computational
          approaches. This is to say it is a lot of fun. Additionally, this
          line of inquiry gives me a nice parachute--think self-help books
          with titles like 'fake it 'till you believe you've made it'

          I am primarily interested in cognitive mechanisms that enable the
          processing and understanding of non-literal language such as metaphor,
          hyperbole, and word play. In particular, I aim to use behavioral
          experiments and computational models to examine how people infer rich
          meanings from sparse and often ambiguous linguistic input.

          Very broadly, I'm interested in studying the role of emotions in
          the context of decision making and how that plays into our intuitive
          theories of (ourselves and) other people, via computational modeling
          and behavioral experiments.

          There are these things called ideas and some seem exact. And yet
          communication with natural language &mdash; our primary mode of
          conveying these ideas &mdash; is anything but!

          I'm interested in this interplay between natural and formal language,
          between the fuzzy and the sharp. I use computational models and
          behavioral experiments to explore how logic and language interact.

          My primary interests are in social cognition: how do we represent
          knowledge about one another and reason with that knowledge? What
          principles and cognitive processes underlie our interactions? How
          do individuals organize themselves into structured collectives? How
          do conventions emerge within those structures?

          I use an interdisciplinary combination of computational and
          experimental methods to investigate these questions, including game
          theory, information theory, artificial intelligence, pragmatics, and
          traditional cognitive psychology.

          People use language in interesting ways that depend on context and
          communicative goals, but also follow consistent patterns and
          structures. I'm interested in understanding the kinds of inferences
          that allow people to interpret language flexibly and assign more
          specific meaning to vague statements. I also want to understand
          how people explain events and regularities they observe in the world
          using language.

          How is communication possible given the severely restricted
          information that we have about the world and each other? An answer
          to this question must account for an old paradox: meaning is
          productive (compositional), yet actual semantic and pragmatic
          interpretation are flexible, context-sensitive, and non-deterministic.
          My research combines formal methods from compositional
          model-theoretical semantics and formal pragmatics with ideas from
          work on reasoning and concepts in computational cognitive science,
          working toward a comprehensive probabilistic semantics and Bayesian
          pragmatics that makes precise and testable quantitative predictions.
          I've worked in particular on epistemic and deontic modality,
          vagueness and gradability, reasoning with modals and degree
          expressions, and presupposition, and am currently pursuing projects
          on probabilistic quantification and reasoning with generics.
