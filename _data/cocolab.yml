          A remarkable feature of human language is that listeners typically
          have little difficulty inferring what a speaker intends to convey
          even though much of the relevant information is not encoded
          explicitly in the utterance. I use behavioral and computational
          methods to study how listeners settle on an interpretation, given
          an underspecified utterance. I'm particularly interested in how the
          more fixed, semantic aspects of utterances interact with contextual
          information and principles of cooperative communication.

          I'm Swiss, and I received my BSc in Cognitive Science from the
          University of Osnabr&uuml;ck in 2005, my MSc in Cognitive Science from
          the University of Osnabr&uuml;ck in 2008, and my PhD in Brain and
          Cognitive Sciences and Linguistics from the University of Rochester
          in 2013.

          Very broadly, I'm interested in studying the role of emotions in
          the context of decision making and how that plays into our intuitive
          theories of (ourselves and) other people, via computational modeling
          and behavioral experiments.

          I'm also interested in prosociality, social cognition and theory of
          mind; behavioral and neuro-economics, game theory; artificial
          intelligence.

          There are these things called ideas and some seem clear. And yet
          communication with natural language &mdash; our primary mode of
          conveying these ideas &mdash; is anything but!
        - >
          I'm interested in this interplay between natural and formal language,
          between the fuzzy and the sharp. I use computational models and
          behavioral experiments to explore how logic and language interact.

          My primary interests are in social cognition: how do we represent
          knowledge about one another and reason with that knowledge? What
          principles and cognitive processes underlie our interactions? How
          do individuals organize themselves into structured collectives? How
          do conventions emerge within those structures?
        - >
          I use an interdisciplinary combination of computational and
          experimental methods to investigate these questions, including game
          theory, information theory, artificial intelligence, pragmatics, and
          traditional cognitive psychology.

          I'm interested in language, explanation, and inference. I use
          computational models and behavioral experiments to study how
          people communicate to one another their beliefs about
          the state and causal mechanisms in the world.

          I'm interested in problems at the intersection of language and
          vision. I develop probabilistic and neural network models with the
          joint objective of explaining human behavioral data and building AI
          with more human-like representations and capacities.
