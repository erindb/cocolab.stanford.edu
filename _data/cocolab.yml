          I'm interested in vague language, causal reasoning, discourse
          relations, and sentence meaning representation.

          What is the impact of language on cognition? What is the impact of
          cognition on language? While the first question is concerned with
          *representation* -- how the information encoded in language influences
          the way we understand and perceive the world, the second is concerned
          with *design* -- how distributional properties found in natural
          languages emerge from local interactions between speakers and
          listeners. I take a computational approach to these questions using
          tools from Bayesian cognitive modeling, agent-based simulation and
          machine learning.

          My research interests are in operationalizing language for machine
          learning. This involves (1) building machines that can learn from
          (and teach with) language and interactive dialog, and (2) using
          language as a structured and compositional guide for learning.
