          A remarkable feature of human language is that listeners typically
          have little difficulty inferring what a speaker intends to convey
          even though much of the relevant information is not encoded
          explicitly in the utterance. I use behavioral and computational
          methods to study how listeners settle on an interpretation, given
          an underspecified utterance. I'm particularly interested in how the
          more fixed, semantic aspects of utterances interact with contextual
          information and principles of cooperative communication.

          I'm Swiss, and I received my BSc in Cognitive Science from the
          University of Osnabr&uuml;ck in 2005, my MSc in Cognitive Science from
          the University of Osnabr&uuml;ck in 2008, and my PhD in Brain and
          Cognitive Sciences and Linguistics from the University of Rochester
          in 2013.

          Central to theories of natural language are speakers' mental
          representations of the words they use, together with the ways these
          representations are employed in computing the meaning of the sentences
          that contain them. Identifying the mental representations of our
          speech and the computational system that manipulates them informs
          not just the cognitive underpinnings of language, but also how the
          mind works more generally. My work investigates these representations
          as a means to further our understanding of language and the
          psychological systems that shape it. Recent projects have focused
          on linguistic phenomena that appeal to or facilitate measurement,
          targeting representations of plurality, degree, and number.

          Originally from Maine, I received my BA in Linguistics and in
          Philosophy from Boston University. I then crossed the Charles River to
          join the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University, where I
          received my PhD in 2014.

          I want to understand how to represent, learn, and reason with
          structured knowledge. I work on probabilistic programming as a means
          of knowledge representation, and probabilistic inference as a method
          of machine learning and reasoning. I am broadly interested in topics
          in cognitive science and artificial intelligence that contribute to
          this project, including concept learning, theory of mind, game
          theory, and decision theory.

          I do research on human learning with the ultimate goal of helping
          improve education. Using behavioral experiments and computational
          models, I investigate how people learn and generalize concepts and
          skills.

          I am primarily interested in cognitive mechanisms that enable the
          processing and understanding of non-literal language such as metaphor,
          hyperbole, and word play. In particular, I aim to use behavioral
          experiments and computational models to examine how people infer rich
          meanings from sparse and often ambiguous linguistic input.

          Very broadly, I'm interested in studying the role of emotions in
          the context of decision making and how that plays into our intuitive
          theories of (ourselves and) other people, via computational modeling
          and behavioral experiments.

          I'm also interested in prosociality, social cognition and theory of
          mind; behavioral and neuro-economics, game theory; artificial
          intelligence.

          There are these things called ideas and some seem clear. And yet
          communication with natural language &mdash; our primary mode of
          conveying these ideas &mdash; is anything but!

          I'm interested in this interplay between natural and formal language,
          between the fuzzy and the sharp. I use computational models and
          behavioral experiments to explore how logic and language interact.

          My primary interests are in social cognition: how do we represent
          knowledge about one another and reason with that knowledge? What
          principles and cognitive processes underlie our interactions? How
          do individuals organize themselves into structured collectives? How
          do conventions emerge within those structures?

          I use an interdisciplinary combination of computational and
          experimental methods to investigate these questions, including game
          theory, information theory, artificial intelligence, pragmatics, and
          traditional cognitive psychology.

          I'm interested in language, explanation, and inference. I use
          computational models and behavioral experiments to study how
          people communicate to one another their beliefs about
          the state and causal mechanisms in the world.
