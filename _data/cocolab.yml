          I'm interested in how visual perception, action, and social inference are coordinated to support learning and communication.
          To get at this, I derive inspiration from how people draw.

          I received my PhD in cognitive psychology from Princeton in 2016, and my AB in neurobiology
          from Harvard in 2010.

          I'm interested in the cognitive mechanisms that allow people to
          flexibly coordinate with one another. In particular, I study the
          formation of conventions and norms using multi-player experiments and
          computational models of communication and social reasoning.

          What is the impact of language on cognition? What is the impact of
          cognition on language? While the first question is concerned with
          *representation* -- how the information encoded in language influences
          the way we understand and perceive the world, the second is concerned
          with *design* -- how distributional properties found in natural
          languages emerge from local interactions between speakers and
          listeners. I take a computational approach to these questions using
          tools from Bayesian cognitive modeling, agent-based simulation and
          machine learning.

          My current research interests are in bayesian deep learning,
          sampling methods, and inference in generative models.
