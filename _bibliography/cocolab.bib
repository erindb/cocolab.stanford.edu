  Abstract = {People tend to judge themselves as exhibiting above average levels of desirable traits---including competence, kindness, and life satisfaction---but does this self-enhancement extend to emotional responses? Here, we explore this question by having people attribute emotions to themselves and others following simple gambles. We demonstrate that people display an emotional self-enhancement bias that varies with the context of the emotion-eliciting situation. People judge themselves as experiencing more positive emotional reactions on average, and they also believed that others’ emotions are more sensitive to gamble outcomes, such that people judge others to experience stronger negative affect in response to negative outcomes (Study 1). This self-enhancement bias further tracks social distance, such that people attribute less positive and more negative emotion to more dissimilar, as compared to more similar others (Study 2). People also predict less favorable emotional states for themselves and others experiencing events in the future, as compared to the present (Study 3), suggesting that this attribution bias extends across multiple dimensions of psychological distance. Broadly, these data suggest that people exhibit self-enhancement in emotion attribution, but do so in subtle ways that depend on situational and social factors.},

	Abstract = {Sentence vectors represent an appealing approach to meaning: learn an embedding that encompasses the meaning of a sentence in a single vector, that can be used for a variety of semantic tasks. Existing models for learning sentence embeddings either require extensive computational resources to train on large corpora, or are trained on costly, manually curated datasets of sentence relations. We observe that humans naturally annotate the relations between their sentences with discourse markers like "but" and "because". These words are deeply linked to the meanings of the sentences they connect. Using this natural signal, we automatically collect a classification dataset from unannotated text. Training a model to predict these discourse markers yields high quality sentence embeddings. Our model captures complementary information to existing models and achieves comparable generalization performance to state of the art models.},

	Abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAEs) learn representations of data by jointly training a probabilistic
encoder and decoder network. Typically these models encode all features of the data into a
single variable. Here we are interested in learning disentangled representations that encode
distinct aspects of the data into separate variables. We propose to learn such representations
using model architectures that generalize from standard VAEs, employing a general graphical
model structure in the encoder and decoder. This allows us to train partially-specified models
that make relatively strong assumptions about a subset of interpretable variables and rely on
the flexibility of neural networks to learn representations for the remaining variables. We
further define a general objective for semi-supervised learning in this model class, which can be
approximated using an importance sampling procedure. We evaluate our framework’s ability
to learn disentangled representations, both by qualitative exploration of its generative capacity,
and quantitative evaluation of its discriminative ability on a variety of models and datasets.}}

Counterfactual theories of causal judgments predict that people compare what actually happened with what would have happened if the candidate cause had been absent. Process theories predict that people focus only on what actually happened, to assess the mechanism linking candidate cause and outcome. We tracked participants' eye-movements while they judged whether one billiard ball caused another one to go through a gate, or prevented it from going through. Both participants' looking patterns and judgments demonstrate that counterfactual simulation is critical. Participants simulate where the target ball would have gone if the candidate cause had been removed from the scene. The more certain participants were that the outcome would have been different, the stronger their causal judgments. These results provide the first direct evidence for spontaneous counterfactual simulation in an important domain of high-level cognition.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive biases, such as the anchoring bias, pose a serious challenge to rational accounts of human cognition. We investigate whether rational theories can meet this challenge by taking into account the mind's bounded cognitive resources. We asked what reasoning under uncertainty would look like if people made rational use of their finite time and limited cognitive resources. To answer this question, we applied a mathematical theory of bounded rationality to the problem of numerical estimation. Our analysis led to a rational process model that can be interpreted in terms of anchoring-and-adjustment. This model provided a unifying explanation for ten anchoring phenomena including the differential effect of accuracy motivation on the bias towards provided versus self-generated anchors. Our results illustrate the potential of resource-rational analysis to provide formal theories that can unify a wide range of empirical results and reconcile the impressive capacities of the human mind with its apparently irrational cognitive biases.}}

	Abstract = {People's estimates of numerical quantities are systematically biased towards their initial guess. This anchoring bias is usually interpreted as sign of human irrationality, but it has recently been suggested that the anchoring bias instead results from people's rational use of their finite time and limited cognitive resources. If this were true, then adjustment should decrease with the relative cost of time. To test this hypothesis, we designed a new numerical estimation paradigm that controls people's knowledge and varies the cost of time and error independently while allowing people to invest as much or as little time and effort into refining their estimate as they wish. Two experiments confirmed the prediction that adjustment decreases with time cost but increases with error cost regardless of whether the anchor was self-generated or provided. These results support the hypothesis that people rationally adapt their number of adjustments to achieve a near-optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff. This suggests that the anchoring bias might be a signature of the rational use of finite time and limited cognitive resources rather than a sign of human irrationality.}}

Experiments show that this combined pragmatic model interprets color descriptions more accurately than the classifiers from which it is built. We observe that pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the model must distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately express the target color. Our findings make use of a newly-collected corpus of human utterances in color reference games, which exhibit a variety of pragmatic behaviors. We also show that the embedded speaker model reproduces many of these pragmatic behaviors.},

	Title = {{Deep Amortized Inference for Probabilistic Programs}},
	Website = {https://dritchie.github.io/pdf/daipp.pdf},
	Year = {Manuscript},
	Abstract = {Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a powerful modeling tool, able to represent any computable probability distribution. Unfortunately, probabilistic program inference is often intractable, and existing PPLs mostly rely on expensive, approximate sampling-based methods. To alleviate this problem, one could try to learn from past inferences, so that future inferences run faster. This strategy is known as amortized inference; it has recently been applied to Bayesian networks and deep generative models. This paper proposes a system for amortized inference in PPLs. In our system, amortization comes in the form of a parameterized guide program. Guide programs have similar structure to the original program, but can have richer data flow, including neural network components. These networks can be optimized so that the guide approximately samples from the posterior distribution defined by the original program. We present a flexible interface for defining guide programs and a stochastic gradient-based scheme for optimizing guide parameters, as well as some preliminary results on automatically deriving guide programs. We explore in detail the common machine learning pattern in which a `local' model is specified by `global' random values and used to generate independent observed data points; this gives rise to amortized local inference supporting global model learning.},

	Abstract = {Generalizations about categories are central to human understanding, and generic language (e.g. Dogs bark.) provides a simple and ubiquitous way to communicate these generalizations. Yet the meaning of generic language is philosophically puzzling and has resisted precise formalization. We explore the idea that the core meaning of a generic sentence is simple but underspecified, and that general principles of pragmatic reasoning are responsible for establishing the precise meaning in context. Building on recent probabilistic models of language understanding, we provide a formal model for the evaluation and comprehension of generic sentences. This model explains the puzzling flexibility in usage of generics in terms of diverse prior beliefs about properties. We elicit these priors experimentally and show that the resulting model predictions explain almost all of the variance in human judgments for both common and novel generics. This theory provides the mathematical bridge between the words we use and the concepts they describe},

	Abstract = {Scientists often run experiments to distinguish competing theories. This requires patience, rigor, and ingenuity - there is often a large space of possible experiments one could run. But we need not comb this space by hand - if we represent our theories as formal models and explicitly declare the space of experiments, we can automate the search for good experiments, looking for those with high expected information gain. Here, we present a general and principled approach to experiment design based on probabilistic programming languages (PPLs). PPLs offer a clean separation between declaring problems and solving them, which means that the scientist can automate experiment design by simply declaring her model and experiment spaces in the PPL without having to worry about the details of calculating information gain. We demonstrate our system in two case studies drawn from cognitive psychology, where we use it to design optimal experiments in the domains of sequence prediction and categorization. We find strong empirical validation that our automatically designed experiments were indeed optimal. We conclude by discussing a number of interesting questions for future research.},

We present results from a large-scale, multi-player replication of the classic tangrams task which demonstrate three key empirical signatures constraining theories of convention-formation: arbitrariness, stability, and reduction of utterance length over time. These results motivate a theory of convention-formation where agents, though initially uncertain about word meanings in context, assume others are using language with such knowledge. Thus, agents may learn about meanings by reasoning about a knowledgeable, informative partner; if all agents engage in such a process, they successfully coordinate their beliefs, giving rise to a conventional communication system. We formalize this theory in a computational model of language understanding as social inference and demonstrate that it produces all three signatures.}}

Since people encounter many closely related distributions, a computationally efficient strategy is to selectively reuse computations -- either the samples themselves or some summary statistic. We refer to these reuse strategies as amortized inference. In two experiments, we present evidence consistent with amortization. When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, we show that answers to the second query vary systematically depending on the structure of the first query. Using a cognitive load manipulation, we find evidence that people cache summary statistics rather than raw sample sets. These results enrich our notions of how the brain approximates probabilistic inference}}

	Abstract = {Why are we polite when we talk to one another? One hypothesis is that people expect others to choose what to say based on their goals both to transfer information efficiently (an epistemic goal) and to make the listener feel good (a social goal). In our previous work, we found that when these two goals conflict, they sometimes produce white lies. In the current work, we expand on this theory to consider another prominent case of polite speech: indirect remarks using negation (e.g., "It wasn't amazing"). With minimal extensions from our previous framework, our formal model suggests that a pragmatic speaker will produce more indirect remarks when the speaker wants to be informative and seem considerate at the same time. These predictions were borne out in an experiment on language production. These findings suggest that the conflict between social and epistemic goals can account for a broad range of politeness phenomena.}}

	Abstract = {Speakers often refer to context only implicitly when using language. The utterance "it's warm outside" could mean it's warm relative to other days of the year or just relative to the current season (e.g., it's warm for winter). Warm vaguely conveys that the temperature is high relative to some contextual comparison class, but little is known about how a listener decides upon such a standard of comparison. Here, we propose that the resolution of a comparison class in context is a pragmatic inference driven by world knowledge and listeners' internal models of speech production. We introduce a Rational Speech Act model and derive two novel predictions from it, which we validate using a paraphrase experiment to measure listeners' beliefs about the likely comparison class used by a speaker. Our model makes quantitative predictions given prior world knowledge for the domains in question. We triangulate this knowledge by a second language task in the same domains, using Bayesian data analysis to infer priors from both data sets.}}

                  people's past choices can inform our inferences about their likes and preferences. If we assume that
                  choices are approximately optimal according to some utility function, we can treat preference inference
                  as Bayesian inverse planning.  That is, given a prior on utility functions and some observed
                  choices, we invert an optimal decision-making process to infer a posterior distribution on utility
                  functions.  However, people often deviate from approximate optimality. They have false beliefs,
                  their planning is sub-optimal, and their choices may be temporally inconsistent due to hyperbolic
                  discounting and other biases.  We demonstrate how to incorporate these deviations into algorithms for

There are two main approaches to account for projection phenomena. The semantic approach adds restrictions of the common ground to the conventional meaning. The pragmatic approach tries to derive projection from general conversational principles. In this paper we build a probabilistic model of language understanding in which the listener jointly infers the world state and what common ground the speaker has assumed. We take change-of-state verbs as an example and model its projective content under negation. Under certain assumptions, the model predicts the projective behavior and its interaction with the question under discussion (QUD), without any special semantic treatment of projective content.},

We use a hierarchical Bayesian data-analysis model for inferring likely population-level beliefs as the central tendency of participants' individual-level beliefs. Three different dependent measures are used to infer latent beliefs: (i) slider ratings of (relative) likelihood of intervals of values, (ii) a give-a-number task, and (iii) choice of the more likely of two intervals of values.

                  other people's behavior. Previous work in lay
                  psychology of behavior have tended to treat emotion
                  as causing primarily unintentional behavior (e.g.,
                  being sad causes one to cry), neglecting how people
                  incorporate emotions into explanations of rational,

                  explorations into integrating emotions into a theory
                  of folk psychology. Specifically, we show that in
                  the lay theory, people are willing to endorse
                  emotions as causes of intentional actions. Moreover,
                  people readily attribute beliefs and desires as

The addition of modifiers (e.g. big dog) has been extensively explored in the literature, but fewer studies have explored the choice of noun, including its level of abstraction. We collected freely produced referring expressions in a multi-player reference game experiment, where we manipulated the object's context. We find that utterance choice is affected by the contextual informativeness of a description, its length and frequency, and the typicality of the object for that description. Finally, we show how these factors naturally enter into a formal model of production within the Rational Speech-Acts framework, and that the resulting model predicts our quantitative production data},

In this paper we argue that these apparent failures are in fact successes. Through a minimal pair of replications comparing scripted vs. unscripted speakers, we show that critical utterances used by Keysar and colleagues are uncooperative: they are less informative than what a speaker would actually produce in that situation. When we allow participants to naturally interact, we find that listener expectations are justified and errors are reduced. This ironically shows that apparent failures of theory of mind are in fact attributable to sophisticated expectations about speaker behavior---that is, to theory of mind.},

We call such models neurally-guided procedural models. As a pre-computation, we train these models to maximize the likelihood of example outputs generated via SMC. They are then used as efficient SMC importance samplers, generating high-quality results with very few samples. We evaluate our method on L-system-like models with image-based constraints. Given a desired quality threshold, neurally-guided models can generate satisfactory results up to 10x faster than unguided models.}}

	Abstract = {Humans skillfully reason about others' emotions, a phenomenon we term affective cognition. Despite its importance, few formal, quantitative theories have described the mechanisms supporting this phenomenon. We propose that affective cognition involves applying domain-general reasoning processes to domain-specific content knowledge. Observers' knowledge about emotions is represented in rich and coherent lay theories, which comprise consistent relationships between situations, emotions, and behaviors. Observers utilize this knowledge in deciphering social agents' behavior and signals (e.g., facial expressions), in a manner similar to rational inference in other domains. We construct a computational model of a lay theory of emotion, drawing on tools from Bayesian statistics, and test this model across four experiments in which observers drew inferences about others' emotions in a simple gambling paradigm. This work makes two main contributions. First, the model accurately captures observers' flexible but consistent reasoning about the ways that events and others' emotional responses to those events relate to each other. Second, our work models the problem of emotional cue integration---reasoning about others' emotion from multiple emotional cues---as rational inference via Bayes' rule, and we show that this model tightly tracks human observers' empirical judgments. Our results reveal a deep structural relationship between affective cognition and other forms of inference, and suggest wide-ranging applications to basic psychological theory and psychiatry.}}

We discuss two phenomena which pose a challenge to these accounts of pragmatics: M-implicatures (Horn, 1984) and embedded implicatures which violate Hurford's constraint (Chierchia, Fox & Spector, 2012; Hurford, 1974). Previous models cannot derive these implicatures, because of basic limitations in their architecture. In order to explain these phenomena, we propose a realignment of the division between semantic content and pragmatic content. Under this proposal, the semantic content of an utterance is not fixed independent of pragmatic inference; rather, pragmatic inference partially determines an utterance's semantic content. We show how semantic inference can be realized as an extension to the Rational Speech Acts framework (Goodman & Stuhlm\"uller, 2013). The addition of lexical uncertainty derives both M-implicatures and the relevant embedded implicatures, and preserves the derivations of more standard implicatures.}}

Although this is certainly true during the earliest stages of phonological development, once a child possesses the basic articulatory skills required for imitation, it need not necessarily be the case. A child could produce a word without possessing the fully formed lexical representation through imitation. In some cases, such as in response to questions containing fixed choices, this behavior could be mistaken for a deeper understanding of the words' semantic content. In this paper, we present evidence that 2to 3-year-old children exhibit a robust recency bias when verbally responding to two-alternative choice questions (i.e., they select the second, most recently mentioned option), possibly due to the availability of the second word in phonological memory. We find further evidence of this effect outside of a laboratory setting in naturalistic conversational contexts in CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000), a large corpus of transcribed child-adult interactions.}}

In contrast to previous Bayesian models of theory acquisition (Tenenbaum, Kemp, Griffiths, & Goodman, 2011), we work with more expressive probabilistic program representations suitable for learning the forces and properties that govern how objects interact in dynamic scenes unfolding over time. We compare our model and human learners on a challenging task of inferring novel physical laws in microworlds given short movies. People are generally able to perform this task and behave in line with model predictions. Yet they also make systematic errors suggestive of how a top-down Bayesian approach to learning might be complemented by a more bottomup feature-based approximate inference scheme, to best explain theory learning at an algorithmic level.}}

In contrast, SMC receives feedback incrementally on incomplete models, allowing it to reallocate computational resources and converge quickly. To handle the many possible sequentializations of a structured, recursive procedural modeling program, we develop and prove the correctness of a new SMC variant, Stochastically-Ordered Sequential Monte Carlo (SOSMC). We implement SOSMC for general-purpose programs using a new programming primitive: the stochastic future. Finally, we show that SOSMC reliably generates high-quality outputs for a variety of programs and control scoring functions. For small computational budgets, SOSMC's outputs often score nearly twice as high as those of MCMC or normal SMC.}}

First, we show that near-miss effects play into observers' intuitive theories of emotion even for randomly-determined outcomes over which agents demonstrably have no control. Second, we find data consistent with a hypothesis in which -- even in randomly determined cases -- near-miss effects reflect an illusion of control over those events. Finally, we integrate near-miss effects into a broader model of affective cognition, and quantify the psychological cost of a missing a desired outcome by relatively little distance, relative to winning or losing that outcome.}}

We then describe two behavioral experiments that examine peoples interpretations of utterances in contexts that afford irony. We show that by minimally extending the hyperbole model to account for two dimensions of affect -- valence and arousal -- our model produces interpretations that closely match humans'.

Such agents are the basis for current computational models of Theory of Mind (ToM), but this fundamental assumption of the theory remains untested. Do people think that others' beliefs are objective, or do they think that others' desires color their beliefs? We describe a Bayesian framework for exploring this relationship and its implications. Motivated by this analysis, we conducted two experiments testing the a priori independence of beliefs and desires in people's ToM and find that, contrary to fully-normative accounts, people think that others engage in wishful thinking. In the first experiment, we found that people think others believe both that desirable events are more likely to happen, and that undesirable ones are less likely to happen. In the second experiment, we found that social learning leverages this intuitive understanding of wishful thinking: participants learned more from the beliefs of an informant whose desires were contrary to his beliefs. People's ToM therefore appears to be more nuanced than the current rational accounts, but consistent with a model in which desire directly affects the subjective probability of an event.}}

We show how whethercausation and how-causation can be implemented in terms of different counterfactual contrasts defined over the same intuitive generative model of the domain. We test the model in an intuitive physics domain where people make judgments about colliding billiard balls. Experiment 1 shows that participants' counterfactual judgments about what would have happened if one of the balls had been removed, are well-explained by an approximately Newtonian model of physics. In Experiment 2, participants judged to what extent two balls were causally responsible for a third ball going through a gate or missing the gate. As predicted by the CSM, participants' judgments increased with their belief that a ball was a whether-cause, a how-cause, as well as sufficient for bringing about the outcome.}}

	Abstract = {World knowledge enters into pragmatic utterance interpretation in complex ways, and may be defeasible in light of speakers' utterances. Yet there is to date a surprising lack of systematic investigation into the role of world knowledge in pragmatic inference. In this paper, we show that a state-of-the-art model of pragmatic interpretation greatly overestimates the influence of world knowledge on the interpretation of utterances like Some of the marbles sank. We extend the model to capture the idea that the listener is uncertain about the background knowledge the speaker is bringing to the conversation. This extension greatly improves model predictions of listeners' interpretation and also makes good qualitative predictions about listeners' judgments of how 'normal' the world is in light of a speaker's statement. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.}}

We test this prediction in two studies, using two different dependent measures, finding that higher cost does predict stronger meanings.

In this paper, we propose two information-theoretic measures---ambiguity and distinctiveness---derived from a simple model of sentence processing. We test these measures on a set of puns and regular sentences and show that they correlate significantly with human judgments of funniness. Moreover, within a set of puns, the distinctiveness measure distinguishes exceptionally funny puns from mediocre ones. Our work is the first, to our knowledge, to integrate a model of general language understanding and humor theory to quantitatively predict humor at a fine-grained level. We present it as an example of a framework for applying models of language processing to understand higher-level linguistic and cognitive phenomena.}}

We propose that it is possible to define levels of analysis that lie between the computational and the algorithmic, providing a way to build a bridge between computational- and algorithmic-level models. The key idea is to push the notion of rationality, often used in defining computational-level models, deeper toward the algorithmic level. We offer a simple recipe for reverse-engineering the mind's cognitive strategies by deriving optimal algorithms for a series of increasingly more realistic abstract computational architectures, which we call "resource-rational analysis."}}

We provide a probabilistic model of reasoning with modal expressions such as "necessary" and "plausible" informed by recent work in formal semantics of natural language, and show that it predicts the possibility of non-linear response patterns which have been claimed to be problematic. Our model also makes a strong monotonicity prediction, while two-dimensional theories predict the possibility of reversals in argument strength depending on the modal word chosen. Predictions were tested using a novel experimental paradigm that replicates the previously-reported response patterns with a minimal manipulation, changing only one word of the stimulus between conditions. We found a spectrum of reasoning "modes" corresponding to different modal words, and strong support for our model's monotonicity prediction. This indicates that probabilistic approaches to reasoning can account in a clear and parsimonious way for data previously argued to falsify them, as well as new, more fine-grained, data. It also illustrates the importance of careful attention to the semantics of language employed in reasoning experiments.}}

Our predictive representations have two key properties: they are productive, and they are graded. Productive generalization is possible because our knowledge decomposes into concepts -- elements of knowledge that are combined and recombined to describe particular situations. Gradedness is the observable effect of accounting for uncertainty -- our knowledge encodes degrees of belief that lead to graded probabilistic predictions. To put this a different way, concepts form a combinatorial system that enables description of many different situations; each such situation specifies a distribution over what we expect to see in the world, given what we have seen. We may think of this system as a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT) in which representations are built from language-like composition of concepts and the content of those representations is a probability distribution on world states. The purpose of this chapter is to formalize these ideas in computational terms, to illustrate key properties of the PLoT approach with a concrete example, and to draw connections with other views of conceptual structure.}}

Indeed, probabilistic models are enormously useful in modeling human cognition (Tenenbaum et al., 2011) and aspects of natural language (Bod et al., 2003; Chater et al., 2006). With a few early exceptions (e.g. Adams, 1975; Cohen, 1999b), probabilistic tools have only recently been used in natural language semantics and pragmatics. In this chapter we synthesize several of these modeling advances, exploring a formal model of interpretation grounded, via lexical semantics and pragmatic inference, in conceptual structure.}}

We find a curious dual trend: if information is costless, as the probability of the event increases people want the information more; if information is not costless, people's desire for the information peaks at an intermediate probability. People also want information more as the importance of the event increases, and less as the cost of the information increases. We propose a model that explains these results, based on the assumption that people have limited cognitive resources and obtain information about which events will occur so they can determine whether to expend effort planning for them.}}

We show that our model predicts humans' interpretation of number words with high accuracy.

Inferences of this sort are difficult for young children, but recent work suggests that this mismatch may stem from issues in understanding the relationship between lexical items like "some" and "all," rather than broader pragmatic deficits. We tested children's ability to make non-quantificational pragmatic inferences by constructing contextually-derived "ad-hoc" implicatures, using sets of pictures with contrasting features. We found that four-year-olds and some three-year-olds were able to make implicatures successfully using these displays. Hence, apparent failures in scalar implicature are likely due to difficulties specific to the constructions and tasks used in previous work; these difficulties may have masked aspects of children's underlying pragmatic competence.}}

We test our model against actualist theories of causation which aim to explain causation just in terms of what actually happened. Our experimental stimuli contrast cases in which we hold constant what actually happened but vary the counterfactual outcome. In support of our model, we find that participants' causal judgments differ drastically between such cases. People's cause and prevention judgments increase with their subjective degree of belief that the counterfactual outcome would have been different from what actually happened.}}

These algorithms are memoryless, in the sense that each query is processed independently, without reuse of earlier computation. We argue that the brain operates in the setting of amortized inference, where numerous related queries must be answered (e.g., recognizing a scene from multiple viewpoints); in this setting, memoryless algorithms can be computationally wasteful. We propose a simple form of flexible reuse, according to which shared inferences are cached and composed together to answer new queries. We present experimental evidence that humans exploit this form of reuse: the answer to a complex query can be systematically predicted from a person's response to a simpler query if the simpler query was presented first and entails a sub-inference (i.e., a sub-component of the more complex query). People are also faster at answering a complex query when it is preceded by a sub-inference. Our results suggest that the astonishing efficiency of human probabilistic reasoning may be supported by interactions between inference and memory.}}

Metaphor in particular has been studied extensively across many disciplines in cognitive science. One approach focuses on the pragmatic principles that listeners utilize to infer meaning from metaphorical utterances. While this approach has generated a number of insights about how people understand metaphor, to our knowledge there is no formal model showing that effects in metaphor understanding can arise from basic principles of communication. Building upon recent advances in formal models of pragmatics, we describe a computational model that uses pragmatic reasoning to interpret metaphorical utterances. We conduct behavioral experiments to evaluate the model's performance and show that our model produces metaphorical interpretations that closely fit behavioral data. We discuss implications of the model for metaphor understanding, principles of communication, and formal models of language understanding}}

	Year = {2013},
	Abstract = {Words are potentially one of the clearest windows on human knowledge and conceptual structure. But what do words mean? In this project we aim to construct and explore a formal model of lexical semantics grounded, via pragmatic inference, in core conceptual structures . Flexible human cognition is derived in large part from our ability to imagine possible worlds. A rich set of concepts, intuitive theories, and other mental representations support imagining and reasoning about possible worlds -- together we call these core cognition. Here we posit that the collection of core concepts also forms the set of primitive elements available for lexical semantics: word meanings are built from pieces of core cognition. We propose to study lexical semantics in the setting of an architecture for language understanding that integrates literal meaning with pragmatic inference. This architecture supports underspecified and uncertain lexical meaning, leading to subtle interactions between meaning, conceptual structure, and context. We will explore several cases of lexical semantics where these interactions are particularly important: indexicals, scalar adjectives, generics, and modals. We formalize both core cognition and the natural language architecture using the Church probabilistic programming language. In this project we aim to contribute to our understanding of the connection between words and mental representations; from this we expect to gain critical insights into many aspects of psychology, to construct vastly more useful thinking machines, and to interface natural and artificial intelligences more efficiently.},

	Abstract = {Language comprehension is more than a process of decoding the literal meaning of a speaker's utterance. Instead, by making the assumption that speakers choose their words to be informative in context, listeners routinely make pragmatic inferences that go beyond the linguistic data. If language learners make these same assumptions, they should be able to infer word meanings in otherwise ambiguous situations. We use probabilistic tools to formalize these kinds of informativeness inferences -- extending a model of pragmatic language comprehension to the acquisition setting -- and present four experiments whose data suggest that preschool children can use informativeness to infer word meanings and that adult judgments track quantitatively with informativeness.}}

	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {In many learning or inference tasks human behavior approximates that of a Bayesian ideal observer, suggesting that, at some level, cognition can be described as Bayesian inference. However, a number of findings have highlighted an intriguing mismatch between human behavior and standard assumptions about optimality: People often appear to make decisions based on just one or a few samples from the appropriate posterior probability distribution, rather than using the full distribution. Although sampling-based approximations are a common way to implement Bayesian inference, the very limited numbers of samples often used by humans seem insufficient to approximate the required probability distributions very accurately. Here, we consider this discrepancy in the broader framework of statistical decision theory, and ask: If people are making decisions based on samples --  but as samples are costly -- how many samples should people use to optimize their total expected or worst-case reward over a large number of decisions? We find that under reasonable assumptions about the time costs of sampling, making many quick but locally suboptimal decisions based on very few samples may be the globally optimal strategy over long periods. These results help to reconcile a large body of work showing sampling-based or probability matching behavior with the hypothesis that human cognition can be understood in Bayesian terms, and they suggest promising future directions for studies of resource-constrained cognition.}}

Our algorithms accumulate information to estimate the local conditional distributions that constitute such a factorization. These stochastic inverses can be used to invert each of the computation steps leading to an observation, sampling backwards in order to quickly find a likely explanation. We show that estimated inverses converge asymptotically in number of (prior or posterior) training samples. To make use of inverses before convergence, we describe the Inverse MCMC algorithm, which uses stochastic inverses to make block proposals for a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. We explore the efficiency of this sampler for a variety of parameter regimes and Bayes nets.}}

These two cases are deeply related: Language users invent new terms in conversation, and language learners learn the literal meanings of words based on their pragmatic inferences about how those words are used. While pragmatic inference and word learning have both been independently characterized in probabilistic terms, no current work unifies these two. We describe a model in which language learners assume that they jointly approximate a shared, external lexicon and reason recursively about the goals of others in using this lexicon. This model captures phenomena in word learning and pragmatic inference; it additionally leads to insights about the emergence of communicative systems in conversation and the mechanisms by which pragmatic inferences become incorporated into word meanings.}}

Humor theorists posit that incongruity -- perceiving a situation from different viewpoints and finding the resulting interpretations to be incompatible -- contributes to sensations of mirth. In this paper, we use a computational model of sentence comprehension to formalize incongruity and test its relationship to humor in puns. By combining a noisy channel model of language comprehension and standard information theoretic measures, we derive two dimensions of incongruity -- ambiguity of meaning and distinctiveness of viewpoints -- and use them to predict humans' judgments of funniness. Results showed that both ambiguity and distinctiveness are significant predictors of humor. Additionally, our model automatically identifies specific features of a pun that make it amusing. We thus show how a probabilistic model of sentence comprehension can help explain essential features of the complex phenomenon of linguistic humor.}}

However, to what extent generalization is also sufficient to explain the transfer has not been examined. Here, we show qualitatively and quantitatively that Bayesian learning of action-outcome contingencies at three levels of abstraction is sufficient to account for the key features of learned helplessness, including escape deficits and impairment of appetitive learning after inescapable shocks.}}

Just as programming beyond the simplest algorithms requires tools for abstraction and composition, complex probabilistic modeling requires new progress in model representation -- probabilistic programming languages. These languages provide compositional means for describing complex probability distributions; implementations of these languages provide generic inference engines: tools for performing efficient probabilistic inference over an arbitrary program.},

We report simulations exploring the effect of background statistical knowledge on adjective interpretation in this model. Motivated by these simulation results, we suggest that this approach can account for the correlation between scale structure and the relative/absolute distinction while also allowing for exceptions noted in previous work. Finally, we argue for a probabilistic explanation of why the sorites paradox is compelling with relative adjectives even though the second premise is false on a universal interpretation, and show that this account predicts Kennedy's (2007) observation that the sorites paradox is more compelling with relative than with absolute adjectives.}}

Much of human reasoning is about the beliefs, desires, and intentions of other people; we use probabilistic programs to formalize these inferences in a way that captures the flexibility and inherent uncertainty of reasoning about other agents. We express examples from game theory, artificial intelligence, and linguistics as recursive probabilistic programs and illustrate how this representation language makes it easy to explore new directions in each of these fields. We discuss the algorithmic challenges posed by these kinds of models and describe how Dynamic Programming techniques can help address these challenges.}}

Both age groups provided more "person" explanations (citing features of the doll) in the person condition than in the situation condition.

	Abstract = {Bayesian inference provides a unifying framework for learning, reasoning, and decision making. Unfortunately, exact Bayesian inference is intractable in all but the simplest models. Therefore minds and machines have to approximate Bayesian inference. Approximate inference algorithms can achieve a wide range of time-accuracy tradeoffs, but what is the optimal tradeoff? We investigate timeaccuracy tradeoffs using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a metaphor for the mind's inference algorithm(s). We characterize the optimal time-accuracy tradeoff mathematically in terms of the number of iterations and the resulting bias as functions of time cost, error cost, and the difficulty of the inference problem. We find that reasonably accurate decisions are possible long before the Markov chain has converged to the posterior distribution, i.e. during the period known as "burn-in". Therefore the strategy that is optimal subject to the mind's bounded processing speed and opportunity costs may perform so few iterations that the resulting samples are biased towards the initial value. The resulting cognitive process model provides a rational basis for the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic. The model's quantitative predictions match published data on anchoring in numerical estimation tasks. In conclusion, resource-rationality -- the optimal use of finite computational resources -- naturally leads to a biased mind.}}

Our algorithm attempts to discover the theory that best explains a set of observed data by performing stochastic search at two levels of abstraction: an outer loop in the space of theories, and an inner loop in the space of explanations or models generated by each theory given a particular dataset. We show that this stochastic search is capable of learning appropriate theories in several everyday domains, and discuss its dynamics in the context of empirical studies of children's learning.}}

We employ a sequence of annealed distributions during the sampling process, allowing us to explore the state space across different dimensionalities more freely. This approach is motivated by the application of layout synthesis where relationships between objects are characterized as constraints. In particular, our method addresses the challenge of synthesizing open world layouts where the number of objects are not fixed and optimal configurations for different numbers of objects may be drastically different. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on two open world layout synthesis problems: coffee shops and golf courses.}}

To interpret the implications of others' actions correctly, learners must understand the people generating the data. Most models of learning, however, assume that data are randomly collected facts about the world, and cannot explain how social contexts influence learning. We provide a Bayesian analysis of learning from knowledgeable others, which formalizes how a learner may reason from a person's actions and goals to infer the actor's knowledge about the world. We illustrate this framework using two examples from causal learning and conclude by discussing the implications for cognition, social reasoning, and cognitive development.}}

Our most sophisticated model is not only able to handle specificity implicature but is also the first formal account of Horn implicatures that correctly predicts human behavior in signaling games with no prior conventions, without appeal to specialized equilibrium selection criteria. Two experiments provide evidence that these implicatures are generated in the absence of prior linguistic conventions or language evolution. Taken together, our modeling and experimental results suggest that the pragmatic effects of alternative utterances can be driven by cooperative social reasoning.}}

	Abstract = {How do people make inferences from complex patterns of evidence across diverse situations? What does a computational model need in order to capture the abstract knowledge people use for everyday reasoning? In this paper, we explore a novel modeling framework based on the probabilistic language of thought (PLoT) hypothesis, which conceptualizes thinking in terms of probabilistic inference over compositionally structured representations. The core assumptions of the PLoT hypothesis are realized in the probabilistic programming language Church (Goodman, Mansinghka, Roy, Bonawitz, & Tenenbaum, 2008). Using "ping pong tournaments" as a case study, we show how a single Church program concisely represents the concepts required to specify inferences from diverse patterns of evidence. In two experiments, we demonstrate a very close fit between our model's predictions and participants' judgments. Our model accurately predicts how people reason with confounded and indirect evidence and how different sources of information are integrated.}}

	Abstract = {There is a long tradition in both philosophy and psychology to separate process accounts from dependency accounts of causation. In this paper, we motivate a unifying account that explains people's causal attributions in terms of counterfactuals defined over probabilistic generative models. In our experiments, participants see two billiard balls colliding and indicate to what extent ball A caused/prevented ball B to go through a gate. Our model predicts that people arrive at their causal judgments by comparing what actually happened with what they think would have happened, had the collision between A and B not taken place. Participants' judgments about what would have happened are highly correlated with a noisy model of Newtonian physics. Using those counterfactual judgments, we can predict participants' cause and prevention judgments very accurately (r = .99). Our framework also allows us to capture intrinsically counterfactual judgments such as almost caused/prevented.}}

We provide a probabilistic model that predicts the observed non-linearities and makes quantitative predictions about responses as a function of argument strength. Predictions were tested using a novel experimental paradigm that elicits the previously-reported response patterns with a minimal manipulation, changing only one word between conditions. We also found a good fit with quantitative model predictions, indicating that a probabilistic theory of reasoning can account in a clear and parsimonious way for qualitative and quantitative data previously argued to falsify them. We also relate our model to recent work in linguistics, arguing that careful attention to the semantics of language used to pose reasoning problems will sharpen the questions asked in the psychology of reasoning.}}

We provide an implemented model that is powerful enough to learn number word meanings and other related conceptual systems from naturalistic data. The model shows that bootstrapping can be made computationally and philosophically wellfounded as a theory of number learning. Our approach demonstrates how learners may combine core cognitive operations to build sophisticated representations during the course of development, and how this process explains observed developmental patterns in number word learning.}}

We explore comparison of pluralities in two experiments, eliciting comparison judgments while varying the properties of the members of each set. We find that a plurality is judged as "bigger" when the mean size of its members is larger than the mean size of the competing plurality. These results are incompatible with previous accounts, in which plural comparison is inferred from many instances of singular comparison between the members of the sets (Matushansky and Ruys, 2006). Our results suggest the need for a type of predication that ascribes properties to plural entities, not just individuals, based on aggregate statistics of their members. More generally, these results support the idea that sets and their properties are actively represented as single units.}}

However, they are also slow, requiring a complete re-execution of the program on every Metropolis Hastings proposal. We present a new extension to the lightweight approach, C3, which enables efficient, incrementalized re-execution of MH proposals. C3 is based on two core ideas: transforming probabilistic programs into continuation passing style (CPS), and caching the results of function calls. We show that on several common models, C3 reduces proposal runtime by 20-100x, in some cases reducing runtime complexity from linear in model size to constant. We also demonstrate nearly an order of magnitude speedup on a complex inverse procedural modeling application.}}

	Abstract = {Many practical techniques for probabilistic inference require a sequence of distributions that interpolate between a tractable distribution and an intractable distribution of interest. Usually, the sequences used are simple, e.g., based on geometric averages between distributions. When models are expressed as probabilistic programs, the models themselves are highly structured objects that can be used to derive annealing sequences that are more sensitive to domain structure. We propose an algorithm for transforming probabilistic programs to coarse-to-fine programs which have the same marginal distribution as the original programs, but generate the data at increasing levels of detail, from coarse to fine. We apply this algorithm to an Ising model, its depth-from-disparity variation, and a factorial hidden Markov model. We show preliminary evidence that the use of coarse-to-fine models can make existing generic inference algorithms more efficient.}}

	Abstract = {This report outlines an approach to learning generative models from data. We express models as probabilistic programs, which allows us to capture abstract patterns within the examples. By choosing our language for programs to be an extension of the algebraic data type of the examples, we can begin with a program that generates all and only the examples. We then introduce greater abstraction, and hence generalization, incrementally to the extent that it improves the posterior probability of the examples given the program. Motivated by previous approaches to model merging and program induction, we search for such explanatory abstractions using program transformations. We consider two types of transformation: Abstraction merges common subexpressions within a program into new functions (a form of anti-unification). Deargumentation simplifies functions by reducing the number of arguments. We demonstrate that this approach finds key patterns in the domain of nested lists, including parameterized sub-functions and stochastic recursion.}}

By manipulating the physical properties of the stimuli, we were able to affect the degree to which candidate variables could be isolated; by manipulating the base rate of candidate causes, we were able to affect the potential for information gain. Children's exploratory play was sensitive to both manipulations: given unambiguous evidence children played indiscriminately and rarely tried to isolate candidate causes; given ambiguous evidence, children both selected (Experiment 1) and designed (Experiment 2) informative interventions.}}

In Experiment 1, we investigated children's exploratory play after an adult pedagogically demonstrated a function of a toy, after an interrupted pedagogical demonstration, after a na{\"\i}ve adult demonstrated the function, and at baseline. Preschoolers in the pedagogical condition focused almost exclusively on the target function; by contrast, children in the other conditions explored broadly. In Experiment 2, we show that children restrict their exploration both after direct instruction to themselves and after overhearing direct instruction given to another child; they do not show this constraint after observing direct instruction given to an adult or after observing a non-pedagogical intentional action. We discuss these findings as the result of rational inductive biases. In pedagogical contexts, a teacher's failure to provide evidence for additional functions provides evidence for their absence; such contexts generalize from child to child (because children are likely to have comparable states of knowledge) but not from adult to child. Thus, pedagogy promotes efficient learning but at a cost: children are less likely to perform potentially irrelevant actions but also less likely to discover novel information.}}

	Abstract = {The prominence of Bayesian modeling of cognition has increased recently largely because of mathematical advances in specifying and deriving predictions from complex probabilistic models. Much of this research aims to demonstrate that cognitive behavior can be explained from rational principles alone, without recourse to psychological or neurological processes and representations. We note commonalities between this rational approach and other movements in psychology -- namely, Behaviorism and evolutionary psychology -- that set aside mechanistic explanations or make use of optimality assumptions. Through these comparisons, we identify a number of challenges that limit the rational program's potential contribution to psychological theory. Specifically, rational Bayesian models are significantly unconstrained, both because they are uninformed by a wide range of process-level data and because their assumptions about the environment are generally not grounded in empirical measurement. The psychological implications of most Bayesian models are also unclear. Bayesian inference itself is conceptually trivial, but strong assumptions are often embedded in the hypothesis sets and the approximation algorithms used to derive model predictions, without a clear delineation between psychological commitments and implementational details. Comparing multiple Bayesian models of the same task is rare, as is the realization that many Bayesian models recapitulate existing (mechanistic level) theories. Despite the expressive power of current Bayesian models, we argue they must be developed in conjunction with mechanistic considerations to offer substantive explanations of cognition. We lay out several means for such an integration, which take into account the representations on which Bayesian inference operates, as well as the algorithms and heuristics that carry it out. We argue this unification will better facilitate lasting contributions to psychological theory, avoiding the pitfalls that have plagued previous theoretical movements.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of learning to act in partially observable, continuous-state-and-action worlds where we have abstract prior knowledge about the structure of the optimal policy in the form of a distribution over policies. Using ideas from planning-as-inference reductions and Bayesian unsupervised learning, we cast Markov Chain Monte Carlo as a stochastic, hill-climbing policy search algorithm. Importantly, this algorithm's search bias is directly tied to the prior and its MCMC proposal kernels, which means we can draw on the full Bayesian toolbox to express the search bias, including nonparametric priors and structured, recursive processes like grammars over action sequences. Furthermore, we can reason about uncertainty in the search bias itself by constructing a hierarchical prior and reasoning about latent variables that determine the abstract structure of the policy. This yields an adaptive search algorithm -- our algorithm learns to learn a structured policy efficiently. We show how inference over the latent variables in these policy priors enables intra- and intertask transfer of abstract knowledge. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach by learning meta search biases, by constructing a nonparametric finite state controller to model memory, by discovering motor primitives using a simple grammar over primitive actions, and by combining all three.},

We show how nonstandard interpretations of probabilistic programs can be used to craft efficient inference algorithms: information about the structure of a distribution (such as gradients or dependencies) is generated as a monad-like side computation while executing the program. These interpretations can be easily coded using special-purpose objects and operator overloading. We implement two examples of nonstandard interpretations in two different languages, and use them as building blocks to construct inference algorithms: automatic differentiation, which enables gradient based methods, and provenance tracking, which enables efficient construction of global proposals.}}

We investigate the origins of scalar implicature using tasks in which the scale arises from real-world context rather than conventional contrasts between lexical items. Experiment 1 shows that these ad-hoc implicatures are easy for preschool children, suggesting that children have an early competence at pragmatic inference, and that failures in standard scalar implicature tasks are due instead to problems contrasting lexical items. Experiments 2 and 3 compare a Gricean, counterfactual account of implicature with a linguistic alternatives account and find that neither predicts effects of contextual informativeness.

We explore the relative learning speeds of abstract and specific knowledge within a Bayesian framework, and the role for innate structure. We focus on knowledge about causality, seen as a domain-general intuitive theory, and ask whether this knowledge can be learned from cooccurrence of events. We begin by phrasing the causal Bayes nets theory of causality, and a range of alternatives, in a logical language for relational theories. This allows us to explore simultaneous inductive learning of an abstract theory of causality and a causal model for each of several causal systems. We find that the correct theory of causality can be learned relatively quickly, often becoming available before specific causal theories have been learned -- an effect we term the blessing of abstraction. We then explore the effect of providing a variety of auxiliary evidence, and find that a collection of simple "perceptual input analyzers" can help to bootstrap abstract knowledge. Together these results suggest that the most efficient route to causal knowledge may be to build in not an abstract notion of causality, but a powerful inductive learning mechanism and a variety of perceptual supports. While these results are purely computational, they have implications for cognitive development, which we explore in the conclusion.}}

These behaviors are advantageous in allowing sequential behaviors to be performed without cognitive overload, and appear to rely on neural circuits that are relatively benign but vulnerable to takeover by extreme contexts, neuropsychiatric sequelae, and processes leading to addiction. Reinforcement learning (RL) is thought to underlie the formation of optimal habits. However, this theoretic formulation has principally been tested experimentally in simple stimulus-response tasks with relatively few available responses. We asked whether RL could also account for the emergence of habitual action sequences in realistically complex situations in which no repetitive stimulus-response links were present and in which many response options were present. We exposed naive macaque monkeys to such experimental conditions by introducing a unique free saccade scan task. Despite the highly uncertain conditions and no instruction, the monkeys developed a succession of stereotypical, self-chosen saccade sequence patterns. Remarkably, these continued to morph for months, long after session-averaged reward and cost (eye movement distance) reached asymptote. Prima facie, these continued behavioral changes appeared to challenge RL. However, trial-by-trial analysis showed that pattern changes on adjacent trials were predicted by lowered cost, and RL simulations that reduced the cost reproduced the monkeys' behavior. Ultimately, the patterns settled into stereotypical saccade sequences that minimized the cost of obtaining the reward on average. These findings suggest that brain mechanisms underlying the emergence of habits, and perhaps unwanted repetitive behaviors in clinical disorders, could follow RL algorithms capturing extremely local explore/exploit tradeoffs.}}

Grice's pragmatic maxims (e.g., ``be relevant'', ``be informative'') have served as an informal guide for understanding how speakers select which pieces of information to include in descriptions. We present a formalization of Grice's maxim of informativeness (``choose descriptions proportional to the number of bits they convey about the referent with respect to context'') and test its ability to capture human performance.

Experiment 1: Participants saw sets of four simple objects that varied on two dimensions (e.g., texture and shape) and were asked to provide the relative probabilities of using two different adjectives (e.g., polka-dot vs. square) to describe a target object relative to the distractor objects. Participants' mean probabilities were highly correlated with the information theoretic model's predictions for the relative informativeness of the two adjectives (r=.92,p<.0001).

Experiment 2: Participants described street scenes from a database of hand-segmented and labeled images (LabelMe). In the context condition, participants were presented with a set of six scenes, one target and five distractors, and were asked to name five objects in the target scene so that another observer could pick that scene out of the set. In the no-context condition, another group of participants performed the same task without seeing the distractors. The information-theoretic model was strongly correlated with differences in object labeling between context and no-context conditions (r=.67,p<.0001), suggesting that the model captures the effect of context on descriptor choice.

Our results suggest that speakers' image descriptions conform to optimal pragmatic norms and that information theory can define norms for the linguistic compression of visual information. This constitutes a first step towards understanding how the visual world is captured and communicated by language users.}}

	Abstract = {Much of human learning occurs in social situations, and among these, pedagogical situations may afford the most powerful learning. In pedagogical situations, a teacher chooses the concept that they are going to teach and the examples that they use to teach the concept. If learners know that a teacher is helpful and understands the implications, this could support strong inferences. In previous work, Shafto and Goodman (2008) proposed and tested a model of pedagogical data selection. We integrate special-purpose pedagogical expectations in this framework, and derive a task that allows independent assessment of pedagogical expectations. Two experiments contrast people's expectations about pedagogical and communicative situations. The results show that people's expectations differ in these situations, and that in pedagogical situations people expect teachers to present generalizable and semantically coherent knowledge. We discuss the implications for modeling learning in pedagogical settings, as well as for understanding human learning more broadly.}}

We describe an approach to concept representation and learning that attempts to capture such structured objects. This approach builds on recent probabilistic approaches, viewing concepts as generative processes, and on recent rule-based approaches, constructing concepts inductively from a language of thought. Concepts are modeled as probabilistic programs that describe generative processes; these programs are described in a compositional language. In an exploratory concept learning experiment, we investigate human learning from sets of tree-like objects generated by processes that vary in their abstract structure, from simple prototypes to complex recursions. We compare human categorization judgements to predictions of the true generative process as well as a variety of exemplar-based heuristics.}}

Even young infants can infer the goals of intentional agents from observing how they interact with objects and other agents in their environment: e.g., that one agent is `helping' or `hindering' another's attempt to get up a hill or open a box. We propose a model for how people can infer these social goals from actions, based on inverse planning in multiagent Markov decision problems (MDPs). The model infers the goal most likely to be driving an agent's behavior by assuming the agent acts approximately rationally given environmental constraints and its model of other agents present. We also present behavioral evidence in support of this model over a simpler, perceptual cue-based alternative.}}

This allows us to explore simultaneous inductive learning of an abstract theory of causality and a causal model for each of several causal systems. We find that the correct theory of causality can be learned relatively quickly, often becoming available before specific causal theories have been learned---an effect we term the "blessing of abstraction". We then explore the effect of providing a variety of auxiliary evidence, and find that a collection of simple "input analyzers" can help to bootstrap abstract knowledge. Together these results suggest that the most efficient route to causal knowledge may be to build in not an abstract notion of causality, but a powerful inductive learning mechanism and a variety of perceptual supports. While these results are purely computational, they have implications for cognitive development, which we explore in the conclusion.}}

	Abstract = {In many learning or inference tasks human behavior approximates that of a Bayesian ideal observer, suggesting that, at some level, cognition can be described as Bayesian inference. However, a number of findings have highlighted an intriguing mismatch between human behavior and standard assumptions about optimality: People often appear to make decisions based on just one or a few samples from the appropriate posterior probability distribution, rather than using the full distribution. Although sampling-based approximations are a common way to implement Bayesian inference, the very limited numbers of samples often used by humans seem insufficient to approximate the required probability distributions very accurately. Here, we consider this discrepancy in the broader framework of statistical decision theory, and ask: If people are making decisions based on samples -- but as samples are costly -- how many samples should people use to optimize their total expected or worst-case reward over a large number of decisions? We find that under reasonable assumptions about the time costs of sampling, making many quick but locally suboptimal decisions based on very few samples may be the globally optimal strategy over long periods. These results help to reconcile a large body of work showing sampling-based or probability matching behavior with the hypothesis that human cognition can be understood in Bayesian terms, and they suggest promising future directions for studies of resource-constrained cognition.}}

If a child could understand speakers' utterances, it would be easy to learn the meanings of individual words, and once a child knows what many words mean, it is easy to infer speakers' intended meanings. To the beginning learner, however, both individual word meanings and speakers' intentions are unknown. We describe a computational model of word learning that solves these two inference problems in parallel, rather than relying exclusively on either the inferred meanings of utterances or cross-situational word-meaning associations. We tested our model using annotated corpus data and found that it inferred pairings between words and object concepts with higher precision than comparison models. Moreover, as the result of making probabilistic inferences about speakers' intentions, our model explains a variety of behavioral phenomena described in the word-learning literature. These phenomena include mutual exclusivity, one-trial learning, cross-situational learning, the role of words in object individuation, and the use of inferred intentions to disambiguate reference.}}

The model is developed in the context of stochastic functional programming (SFP), and in particular, using a probabilistic variant of Lisp known as the Church programming language [17]. We show how to formalize several probabilistic models of language structure using Church, and how fragment grammar generalizes one of them--- adaptor grammars [21]. We conclude with experimental data with adults and preliminary evaluations of the model on natural language corpus data.}}

We measure the degree of referential continuity in two corpora and then use regression modeling to test whether reference continuity is informative about speakers' referential intentions. We conclude by developing a simple discourse-continuity prior within a Bayesian model of word learning. Our results suggest that discourse continuity may be a valuable information source in early word learning.}}

Here we propose a formal analogue to these accounts: that communicators choose what they want to say by how informative it would be about their intended meaning. We derive quantitative predictions about how this assumption would be used in language production and learning and test these predictions via two experiments. This work takes a first step towards formalizing the pragmatic assumptions necessary for effective communication in under-constrained, real-world situations.}}

Achieving these three desiderata simultaneously is nontrivial. Expressivity can be achieved by using a formalism similar to a programming language, but standard approaches to combining programming languages with probabilities sacrifice random-world semantics. Naive approaches to restoring random-world semantics undermine syntactic independence criteria. Our main result is a syntactic independence criterion that holds for a broad class of highly expressive logics under random-world semantics. We explore various examples including Bayesian networks, probabilistic context-free grammars, and an example from Mendelian genetics. Our independence criterion supports a case-factor inference technique that reproduces both variable elimination for BNs and the inside algorithm for PCFGs.}}

These newly inferred abstract laws were robust to potentially anomalous evidence; in the face of apparent counter-evidence, children (correctly) posited the existence of an unobserved object rather than revise the abstract laws. This suggests that children's ability to learn robust, abstract principles does not depend on extensive prior experience but can occur rapidly, on-line, and in tandem with inferences about specific relations.},

The dominant approach to rational analysis today takes an ecologically reasonable specification of a problem facing an organism, given in statistical terms, then seeks an optimal solution, usually using Bayesian methods. This approach has proven very successful in cognitive science; it has predicted perceptual phenomena (Geisler & Kersten, 2002; Feldman, 2001), illuminated puzzling effects in reasoning (Chater & Oaksford, 1999; Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2006), and, especially, explained how human learning can succeed despite sparse input and endemic uncertainty (Tenenbaum, 1999; Tenenbaum & Griffiths, 2001). However, there were earlier notions of the "rational" analysis of cognition that emphasized very different ideas. One of the central ideas behind logical and computational approaches, which previously dominated notions of rationality, is that meaning can be captured in the structure of representations, but that compositional semantics are needed for these representations to provide a coherent account of thought. In this chapter we attempt to reconcile the modern approach to rational analysis with some aspects of this older, logico-computational approach. We do this via a model---offered as an extended example---of human concept learning. In the current chapter we are primarily concerned with formal aspects of this approach; in other work (Goodman, Tenenbaum, Feldman, & Griffiths, in press) we more carefully study a variant of this model as a psychological model of human concept learning.}}

In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model of causal background knowledge which explains Markov violations and makes additional, more fine-grained predictions on the basis of causally relevant category membership. We confirm these predictions using an experimental paradigm which extends that used in previous studies of "Markov violation."}}

Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models.

	Abstract = {We propose a new model of human concept learning that provides a rational analysis of learning feature-based concepts. This model is built upon Bayesian inference for a grammatically structured hypothesis space -- a concept language of logical rules. We compare the model predictions to human generalization judgments in several well-known category learning experiments, and find good agreement for both average and individual participants generalizations. We further investigate judgments for a broad set of seven-feature concepts -- a more natural setting in several ways -- and again find that the model explains human performance.}}

	Abstract = {Much of human knowledge is organized into sophisticated systems that are often called intuitive theories. We propose that intuitive theories are mentally represented in a logical language, and that the subjective complexity of a theory is determined by the length of its representation in this language. This complexity measure helps to explain how theories are learned from relational data, and how they support inductive inferences about unobserved relations. We describe two experiments that test our approach, and show that it provides a better account of human learning and reasoning than an approach developed by Goodman [1].}}

	Abstract = {Causal inferences about sparsely observed objects are often supported by causal schemata, or systems of abstract causal knowledge. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that learns simple causal schemata given only raw data as input. Given a set of objects and observations of causal events involving some of these objects, our framework simultaneously discovers the causal type of each object, the causal powers of these types, the characteristic features of these types, and the characteristic interactions between these types. Previous behavioral studies confirm that humans are able to discover causal schemata, and we show that our framework accounts for data collected by Lien and Cheng and Shanks and Darby.},

	Abstract = {We address the problem of learning grounded causal models: systems of concepts that are connected by causal relations and explicitly grounded in perception. We present a Bayesian framework for learning these models -- both a causal Bayesian network structure over variables and the consequential region of each variable in perceptual space -- from dynamic perceptual evidence. Using a novel experimental paradigm we show that humans are able to learn grounded causal models, and that the Bayesian model accounts well for human performance.},

	Abstract = {For infants, early word learning is a chicken-and-egg problem. One way to learn a word is to observe that it co-occurs with a particular referent across different situations. Another way is to use the social context of an utterance to infer the intended referent of a word. Here we present a Bayesian model of cross-situational word learning, and an extension of this model that also learns which social cues are relevant to determining reference. We test our model on a small corpus of mother-infant interaction and find it performs better than competing models. Finally, we show that our model accounts for experimental phenomena including mutual exclusivity, fast-mapping, and generalization from social cues.}}

	Abstract = {We propose a rational analysis of children's false belief reasoning. Our analysis realizes a continuous, evidencedriven transition between two causal Bayesian models of false belief. Both models support prediction and explanation; however, one model is less complex while the other has greater explanatory resources. Because of this explanatory asymmetry, unexpected outcomes weigh more heavily against the simpler model. We test this account empirically by showing children the standard outcome of the false belief task and a novel "psychic" outcome. As expected, we find children whose explanations and predictions are consistent with each model, and an interaction between prediction and explanation. Critically, we find unexpected outcomes only induce children to move from predictions consistent with the simpler model to those consistent with the more complex one, never the reverse.}}
