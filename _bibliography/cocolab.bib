	Abstract = {Given minimal evidence about novel objects, children might learn only
	relationships among the specific entities, or they might make a more
	abstract inference, positing classes of entities and the relations
	that hold among those classes. Here we show that preschoolers (mean:
	57 months) can use sparse data about perceptually unique objects
	to infer abstract physical causal laws. These newly inferred abstract
	laws were robust to potentially anomalous evidence; in the face of
	apparent counter-evidence, children (correctly) posited the existence
	of an unobserved object rather than revise the abstract laws. This
	suggests that children's ability to learn robust, abstract principles
	does not depend on extensive prior experience but can occur rapidly,
	on-line, and in tandem with inferences about specific relations.},
